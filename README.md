## 2D vs 3D Implementations


The 2D version was made using visNetwork. I wanted interactivity between the two 
<br>
graphs, and visNetwork allowed me to highlight the same node on both networks.
<br>
When using this version, I suggest enabling the **Hovering Animation** checkbox.

The 3D version was made using three.js. This one allows the ability to view the 
<br>
two networks ontop of each other in 3D space, however there were some issues 
<br>
as I was unable to make the two graphs appear closer, and there was no easy way 
<br>
of implementing interactivity.
